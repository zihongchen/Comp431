Chapter 1 problem - Circuit Switching vs Packet Switching
Assume a 1 Mbps shared link:

each user is active only 10% of the time, and
each user consumes 100 Kbps when "active".
 



 

a) How many users can circuit switching support? Why?

 

b) How many users can packet switching support (so that probability of not providing to users is less than 0.0004)? Why?

 
 
 
 
 
 a) 10. 1Mbps/100Kbps=10
b.) P(x) = (n choose x) * p^x * (1-p) ^ (n-x) <--- Binomial Distribution Formula

Where P(x) is the overall probability (we want < .0004)

n is the total number of users (unknown)

x is number of active users the link can handle (10)

p is probability that a given user is active (.10)

 

Solving for n yields 35 as the max number of users the link can handle with packet switching.

 

b) ∑35x=11(35n)(.1)n(.9)35−n≃.00042
